-phylogenetic profiles across species

-expression profiles across tissue types

-GO semantic similarities

Golang

the follwing components are to implemented.

-fast pearson correlation coefficient calculation for large matrix.

-base learner generater using pathway definition and prior matrix.

-ensemble learning framework.
